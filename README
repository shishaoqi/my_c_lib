README file for the unix-xwindows subdirectory

________________________________________________________________________

The unix-xwindows directory contains an implementation of the cslib
library designed for use with XWindows (version X11) on Unix systems.
The development and testing of the package has been performed using the
gcc compiler, which is available without charge from the GNU project at
MIT.  The procedure described below may work with other compilers as
well, but the results are far less certain.

TO INSTALL THE UNIX/XWINDOWS VERSION OF THE LIBRARIES ON YOUR MACHINE:

1.  Use FTP to retrieve the file cslib.shar from the unix-xwindows
    directory of the aw.com archive to the home directory on your
    machine.

2.  Execute the cslib.shar script by typing

         sh cslib.shar

    Executing the script creates a top-level directory called cslib that
    contains all of the relevant files.

3.  Connect to the cslib directory.

4.  Rebuild the object files and libraries by typing

         make

    Note: This step assumes that you are using gcc as your compiler.  If
    you want to use a different compiler, you will need to edit the
    Makefile accordingly.

5.  Copy the file gccx from the cslib directory into a directory on your
    command search path.  If you will be the only person using the
    libraries, you could put this file in your private command
    directory, which is usually ~/bin.  If you are installing this
    command for use by any user on the system, you will need to put it
    in a public directory, such as /usr/local/bin.  For public
    installation to work, your cslib directory must be readable by other
    users.

COMPILING PROGRAMS ON AN XWINDOWS SYSTEM

The gccx command produced by the Makefile is a shell script that acts
like gcc except that it automatically arranges to include the cslib
header files and libraries whenever it is invoked as a command.  For
example, to create an executable application from the source file
house.c, all you need to do is type:

     gccx -o house house.c

NOTES AND DISCLAIMERS

The cslib libraries are in the public domain and may be freely copied
and distributed, although they remain under development.  No warranties
are made concerning their correctness or stability, and no user support
is guaranteed.  Bug reports and suggestions, however, are appreciated
and may be sent to
